# ðŸ•Š Twitter-demo-web-app

My project is a Demo of Twitter website, Users were able to share their thoughts with each other, also share photos, and comment on each other's tweets and like them . I also put a news summary on the main page and users can read the headlines.
Thank you to My Instructor <strong>Daniel Scotts</strong> for offering me great features to add to my project also his amazing workshops.
